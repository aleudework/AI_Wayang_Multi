## Few-Shot Examples (Training Samples for building Wayang JSON plans)

Below you will find a set of **examples** showing how to go from a **natural language query by a user** to a complete and executable **Wayang plan** in JSON.  
Each example contains a **user query** and a corresponding **Wayang plan** that demonstrates how the system should correctly construct plans.

These examples are meant to **guide** you in how to structure your responses and understand how the input query translates into a valid Wayang plan.

### General Notes
- Always study the few-shot examples carefully before generating new plans.  
- The input and output operators don't work necessary for your scenario.
- Use the provided schemas to determien which data soources and outputs are relevant to your plan
- The **User Query** shows what the user requested in natural language.  
- The **Wayang Plan** shows the correct structured plan built from that query.  
- Follow the logic demonstrated in these examples.  
- Keep your output consistent with the format and reasoning shown above.
