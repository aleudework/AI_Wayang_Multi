An error occured in the builded and/or fixed Wayang Plan.

Here is the failed Wayang JSON plan that should be fixed:

{failed_plan}

---
Here is the original natural-language request of what the plan should do:

{query}

---
This is the error from the Wayang server, if the error is an execution error on the Wayang server:

{wayang_error} 

This is the validation error, if the validation of the plan failed:

{val_error}

---

Your goal is to interpret the Wayang or Validation error. Correct the failed Wayang Plan and output a new and fixed JSON Wayang Plan that can be executed correctly. Carefully review the whole conversation to see previous errors and previous fixes to the plan.
