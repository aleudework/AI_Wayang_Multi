This is the previous generated steps by Builders or subtasks leading up to the task.

If it is an input step, there is nothing previously:

{previous_steps}

This is the high level step you should turn into executable Wayang operators:

{step}

Make sure your generated Wayang Plan **ONLY** is your part, or output your part of the plan and not the previous builded operators. All sub plans or steps will be linked together at the end.
