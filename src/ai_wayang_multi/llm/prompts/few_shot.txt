## Few-Shot Examples (Training Samples for building Wayang JSON plans)

Below you will find a set of **examples** showing **natural-language request** and finalized, executable **JSON Wayang Plans** that fulfill the requests.

Each example contains a **request** and a finalized **Wayang Plan** in JSON.

These examples are meant to **guide** you how to correctly structure your response and understand how a natural-langauge requests translates into a valid Wayang plan, and how operators work together.

The content of these requests and data sources used for these plans may not be a part of your available data sources. They are only for illustration.

### General Notes
- Always study the few-shot examples carefully before generating new plans.  
- The input and output operators don't work necessary for your scenario.
- Use the provided schemas to determine which data sources and outputs are relevant to your plan
- The **User Query** shows what the user requested in natural language.  
- The **Wayang Plan** shows the correct structured plan built from that query.  
- Follow the logic demonstrated in these examples.  
- Keep your output consistent with the format and reasoning shown above.
