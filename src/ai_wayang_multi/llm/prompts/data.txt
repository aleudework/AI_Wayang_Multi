## Data Definition (Available Data Sources)

You can only use the following **tables** or **text files** as data sources.  
Each table contains a set of **columns** with defined meanings.

## Data Information Provided To You

For each **table**, you will recieve:
- The **table name**
- The **column names**
- Their **data types**
- **Two random example values** for each column

For each **text file**, you will recieve:
- The **file name**
- The **first two lines** of the file as sample content

Sometimes a description is provided to the table or text file for you to better understand the meaning and use of table. Other times, there is no description and you must provide the meaning yourself out of the names, data types and examples provided.

This information is provided to you to help you understand the structure and the nature of the available data. Review it **carefully** before constructing the plan.

### **Text files**

### Important Notes For Input Text Files

Remember that Wayang always reads text files line by line. Pay close attention to the user's query, as you may need
a flatMap or another unary function following to split, so you select words instead of lines.
